# IP Calculator
The purpose of this calculator is to determine the IP address of a host based on the given network address (root IP), subnet mask, and host ID.

Just a simple HTML with a small JS script and a little of CSS pixie dust.

## Instructions on How to Use:

1. **Input the Root IP Address:** Enter the root IP address in the first field. For example, `177.0.0.0`.
2. **Input the Subnet Mask:** Enter the subnet mask in the second field. This could be a number between 0 and 32, representing the number of bits used for the network portion of the address. For instance, if the subnet mask is 8, you're using 8 bits for the network and 24 bits for the host.
3. **Enter the Host ID:** Input the host ID in the last field. This represents the unique identifier of the specific device within that subnet.
4. **Click on Calculate**
